title: Update on the Z-Wave integration
---

At the State of the Union we [introduced that we're working on a new Z-Wave integration](https://youtu.be/tc17q1Zn0Xs?t=4482). It's based on a new project by the Open Z-Wave project called [OZWDaemon](https://github.com/OpenZWave/qt-openzwave) and we will communicate with it over MQTT.

This new approach allows us to integrate directly with the core of Open Z-Wave without relying on bindings via other languages. This allows us to easily keep up to date with the latest Open Z-Wave changes.

There has been some great progress on the integration thanks to [@cgarwood] and [@marcelveldt] and you can start testing it out today as [a custom component](https://github.com/cgarwood/homeassistant-zwave_mqtt#requirements).

The custom component is powered by the new [`python-openzwave-mqtt`](https://github.com/cgarwood/python-openzwave-mqtt) package.

If you find any bugs, please [create an issue](https://github.com/cgarwood/homeassistant-zwave_mqtt/issues/new). If you are using Home Assistant 0.105, use the new `mqtt.dump` service to make a dump of your Open Z-Wave instance and attach that to your issue. The dump will be written to `mqtt_dump.txt` in your config folder.
