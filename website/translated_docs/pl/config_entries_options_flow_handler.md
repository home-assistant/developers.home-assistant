> This option is currently only available for built-in components.

An integration that is configured via a config entry can expose options to the user to allow tweaking behavior of the integration, like which devices or locations should be integrated.

Config Entry Options uses the [Data Flow Entry framework](data_entry_flow_index.md) to allow users to update a config entries options. Components that want to support config entry options will need to define a Options Flow Handler.

## Options support

For an integration to support options it needs to have an `async_get_options_flow` method in its config flow handler. Calling it will return an instance of the components options flow handler.

```python
@staticmethod
@callback
def async_get_options_flow(config, options):
    return OptionsFlowHandler(config, options)
```

## Flow handler

The Flow handler works just like the config flow handler, except that the first step in the flow will always be `async_step_init`.

```python
class OptionsFlowHandler(data_entry_flow.FlowHandler):
    def __init__(self, config, options):
```

## Signal updates

If the component should act on updated options, you can register an update listener to the config entry that will be called when the entry is updated.

```python
entry.add_update_listener(update_listener)
```

The Listener shall be an async function that takes the same input as async_setup_entry. Options can then be accessed from `entry.options`.

```python
async def update_listener(hass, entry):
```
