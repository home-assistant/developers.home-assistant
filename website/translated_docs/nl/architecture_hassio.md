## Host Control (HC)

This is a daemon running on the host machine that allows the supervisor to control certain aspects of the host OS:

- Power cycle (restart, turn off)
- Manage network settings
- Local updates

## Host

Our pre-build images are based on [HassOS](https://github.com/home-assistant/hassos) which is based on [BuildRoot](https://buildroot.org/). Any Linux machine can be turned into a Hass.io host by running [the installer](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/installation/#alternative-install-on-generic-linux-server).

## Supervisor

The supervisor offers an API to manage the host and running the Docker containers.

## Configuration panel

The configuration panel lives inside the supervisor but is accessible via the Home Assistant user interface. The configuration panel allows the user to manage the installation.
