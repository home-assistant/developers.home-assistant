Since 0.92.0, every integration has a manifest file to specify basic information about an integration. This file is stored as `manifest.json` in your integration directory. It is required to add such a file, except for custom components.

```json
{
  "domain": "hue",
  "name": "Philips Hue",
  "documentation": "https://www.home-assistant.io/components/hue",
  "dependencies": ["mqtt"],
  "codeowners": ["@balloob"],
  "requirements": ["aiohue==1.9.1"]
}
```

Or a minimal example that you can copy into your project:

```json
{
  "domain": "your_domain_name",
  "name": "Your Integration",
  "documentation": "https://www.example.com",
  "dependencies": [],
  "codeowners": [],
  "requirements": []
}
```

## Domain

The domain is a short name consisting of characters and underscores. This domain has to be unique and cannot be changed. Example of the domain for the mobile app integration: `mobile_app`.

## Name

The name of the integration.

## Documentation

The website containing documentation on how to use your integration. If this integration is being submitted for inclusion in Home Assistant, it should be `https://www.home-assistant.io/components/<domain>`

## Dependencies

Dependencies are other Home Assistant integrations that you want Home Assistant to set up successfully prior to the integration being loaded. This can be necessary in case you want to offer functionality from that other integration, like using webhooks or an MQTT connection.

## Code Owners

GitHub usernames or team names of people that are responsible for this integration. You should add at least your GitHub username here, as well as anyone who helped you to write code that is being included.

## Requirements

Requirements are Python libraries or modules that you would normally install using `pip` for your component. Home Assistant will try to install the requirements into the `deps` subdirectory of the Home Assistant [configuration directory](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/) if you are not using a `venv` or in something like `path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages` if you running in a virtual environment. This will make sure that all requirements are present at startup. If steps fail, like missing packages for the compilation of a module or other install errors, the component will fail to load.

Requirements is an array of strings. Each entry is a `pip` compatible string. For example, the media player Cast platform depends on the Python package PyChromecast v3.2.0: `["pychromecast==3.2.0"]`.

> Because of how Home Assistant installs requirements on demand, actual Python imports of your requirements should be done inside functions instead of at the root level of your Python files.

### Custom requirements during development & testing

During the development of a component, it can be useful to test against different versions of a requirement. This can be done in two steps, using `pychromecast` as an example:

```bash
pip install pychromecast==3.2.0 --target ~/.homeassistant/deps
hass --skip-pip
```

This will use the specified version, and prevent Home Assistant from trying to override it with what is specified in `requirements`.

If you need to make changes to a requirement to support your component, it's also possible to install a development version of the requirement using `pip install -e`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/balloob/pychromecast.git
pip install -e ./pychromecast
hass --skip-pip
```
