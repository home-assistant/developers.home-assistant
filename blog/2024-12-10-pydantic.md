title: "Pydantic bump to v2"
---

Pydantic is a popular library for data validation in Python.
30 june 2023, Pydantic v2 was released.
This release is not backwards compatible with Pydantic v1.

Home Assistant Core 2024.12 ships with the Pydantic v1 library.
Over the last year, the community has been working on making sure the libraries used by Home Assistant Core are supporting both v1 and v2 of Pydantic.
By supporting both versions, we made our transition to Pydantic v2 as smooth as possible.

From 2025.1, Home Assistant Core is expected to ship with Pydantic v2.
Every custom component that uses Pydantic must be updated to support Pydantic v2 to keep working in Home Assistant Core 2025.1.

For a quick migration, you can use the Pydantic v1 shims that are shipped with Pydantic v2.
Information about that can be found [here](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/migration/#using-pydantic-v1-features-in-a-v1v2-environment).
