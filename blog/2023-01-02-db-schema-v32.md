title: "Database schema v32 updates"
---

For Home Assistant Core 2023.2 the database schema has changed.

This change affects custom integrations that do not use the `recorder` [`history`](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/dev/homeassistant/components/recorder/history.py) API and access the `last_updated`, `last_changed`, or `time_fired` columns directly.

The documentation for the [`events`](https://data.home-assistant.io/docs/events) and [`states`](https://data.home-assistant.io/docs/events/) have been updated and is available at the [Data Science Portal](https://data.home-assistant.io/).
