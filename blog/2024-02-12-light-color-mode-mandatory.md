title: "It is now required for lights to set color mode"
---


## Change

Light entities are now required to set the `supported_color_modes` and `color_mode` properties, and a warning will be logged asking users to report an issue if that's not done.

In addition, a warning will be logged if the light reports an invalid combination of `supported_color_modes` or a `color_mode` other than `ColorMode.UNKNOWN`, which is not included in the light's `supported_color_modes`.

In the Home Assistant 2025.3 release, the warnings will be removed, and lights that have still not been upgraded to a color mode or that violate the color mode rules will no longer work.

More details can be found in the [documentation](/docs/core/entity/light#color-modes).
