title: Introducing description placeholders for service action translations
---
It is now possible to use translation placeholders for (custom) service actions.

The [service action example](/docs/core/integration-quality-scale/rules/action-setup?_highlight=hass.services.async_register#example-implementation) now shows how to supply the available description placeholders during the registration of the service action.

Move URLs from service descriptions and translation strings into description placeholders.
