title: Introducing description placeholders for service action translations
---
It is now possible to use translation placeholders for (custom) service actions.

The [service action example](/docs/core/integration-quality-scale/rules/action-setup?_highlight=hass.services.async_register#example-implementation) now shows how to supply the available description placeholders during the registration of the service action.

URLs that are part of the service transaction should be moved out of the service descriptions and translation strings using the description placeholders.
