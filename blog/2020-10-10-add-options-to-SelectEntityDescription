title: "Add options to SelectEntityDescription"
---

As of Home Assistant Core 2022.11, `options` is available as a standard property of `SelectEntityDescription`.
This may cause issues in custom components if a custom `options` property was previously implemented.

Please adjust the custom component by either dropping or renaming the custom `options` property.
