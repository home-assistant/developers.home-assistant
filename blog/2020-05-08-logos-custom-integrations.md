title: Logos for custom integrations
---

Recently, Home Assistant started to support images & icons for integrations
to show up in the frontend. They look amazing and really brings some color
to the UI of Home Assistant.

We got a lot of questions lately on how custom integrations (also known as
custom components) can add their images. As of today, that is possible!

Created a custom integration? Want the logo & icon for your integration to
show up in the Home Assistant frontend? In that case, head over to our
[GitHub brands repository](https://github.com/home-assistant/brands)
to add yours!

_PS: Did you know you can also add your custom integration to our [Python wheels
repository](https://github.com/home-assistant/wheels-custom-integrations)?
It will make the installation of your custom integration in
Home Assistant lightning fast!_
