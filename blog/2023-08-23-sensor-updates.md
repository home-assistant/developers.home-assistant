Numerical sensors are no longer allowed to set their state to [Not a Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN) or to positive or negative infinity.

The change was introduce in [core PR#98110](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/98110)

For more details, refer to the [`sensor` documentation](/docs/core/entity/sensor).
