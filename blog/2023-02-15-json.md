title: "Refactor json helper and utility"
---

As of Home Assistant Core 2023.3, some constants and functions have been moved
between `homeassistant.helpers.json` and `homeassistant.util.json` :

  - `save_json` and `find_paths_unserializable_data` functions should now be
  imported from `homeassistant.helpers.json`
  - `json_loads` function should now be imported from `homeassistant.util.json`
  - `JSON_ENCODE_EXCEPTIONS` and `JSON_DECODE_EXCEPTIONS` constants should now
  be imported from `homeassistant.util.json`
