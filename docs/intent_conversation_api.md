Intents can be recognized from text and fired using the [conversation integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/conversation/).

An API endpoint is available which receives an input sentence and produces an [intent response](#intent-response). A "conversation" is tracked across multiple inputs and responses by passing a [conversation id](#conversation-id) generated by Home Assistant.

The API is available via the Rest API and Websocket API.

A sentence may be POST-ed to `/api/conversation/process` like:

```json
{
  "text": "turn on the lights in the living room",
  "language": "en"
}
```

Or sent via the WebSocket API like:

```json
{
  "type": "conversation/process",
  "text": "turn on the lights in the living room",
  "language": "en"
}
```

The following input fields are available:

| Name              | Type   | Description                                                                                 |
|-------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `text`            | string | Input sentence.                                                                             |
| `language`        | string | Optional. Language of the input sentence (defaults to configured language).                 |
| `conversation_id` | string | Optional. Unique id to [track conversation](#conversation-id). Generated by Home Assistant. |


## Conversation Response

The JSON response from `/api/conversation/process` contains information about the effect of the fired intent, for example:

```json
{
  "response": {
    "response_type": "action_done",
    "language": "en",
    "data": {
      "targets": [
        {
          "type": "area",
          "name": "Living Room",
          "id": "living_room"
        },
        {
          "type": "domain",
          "name": "light",
          "id": "light"
        }
      ],
      "success": [
        {
          "type": "entity",
          "name": "My Light",
          "id": "light.my_light"
        }
      ],
      "failed": [],
    },
    "speech": {
      "plain": {
        "speech": "Turned Living Room lights on"
      }
    }
  },
  "conversation_id": "<generated-id-from-ha>",
}
```

The following properties are available in the `"response"` object:

| Name            | Type       | Description                                                                                                      |
|-----------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `response_type` | string     | One of `action_done`, `query_answer`, or `error` (see [response types](#response-types)). |
| `data`          | dictionary | Relevant data for each [response type](#response_types).                                                         |
| `language`      | string     | The language of the intent and response.                                                                         |
| `speech`        | dictionary | Optional. Response text to speak to the user (see [speech](#speech)).                                            |


The [conversation id](#conversation-id) is returned alongside the intent response.


## Response Types

### Action Done

The intent produced an action in Home Assistant, such as turning on a light. The `data` property of the response contains a `targets` list, where each target looks like:

| Name       | Type    | Description                                                                            |
|------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `type`     | string  | Target type. One of `area`, `domain`, `device_class`, `device`, `entity`, or `custom`. |
| `name`     | string  | Name of the affected target.                                                           |
| `id`       | string  | Optional. Id of the target.                                                            |

Two additional target lists are included, containing the devices or entities that were a `success` or `failed`:

```json
{
  "response": {
    "response_type": "action_done",
    "data": {
      "targets": [
        (area or domain)
      ],
      "success": [
        (entities/devices that succeeded)
      ],
      "failed": [
        (entities/devices that failed)
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

An intent can have multiple targets which are applied on top of each other. The targets must be ordered from general to specific:

* `area`
  * A [registered area](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/area_registry_index/)
* `domain`
  * Home Assistant integration domain, such as "light"
* `device_class`
  * Device class for a domain, such as "garage_door" for the "cover" domain
* `device`
  * A [registered device](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/device_registry_index)
* `entity`
  * A [Home Assistant entity](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/architecture/devices-and-services)
* `custom`
  * A custom target

Most intents end up with 0, 1 or 2 targets. 3 targets currenly only happens when device classes are involved. Examples of target combinations:

 * "Turn off all lights"
     * 1 target: `domain:light`
 * "Turn on the kitchen lights"
     * 2 targets: `area:kitchen`, `domain:light`
 * "Open the kitchen blinds"
     * 3 targets: `area:kitchen`, `domain:cover`, `device_class:blind`


### Query Answer

The response is an answer to a question, such as "what is the temperature?". See the [speech](#speech) property for the answer text.

```json
{
  "response": {
    "response_type": "query_answer",
    "language": "en",
    "speech": {
      "plain": {
        "speech": "It is 65 degrees"
      }
    },
    "data": {
      "targets": [
        {
          "type": "domain",
          "name": "climate",
          "id": "climate"
        }
      ],
      "success": [
        {
          "type": "entity",
          "name": "Ecobee",
          "id": "climate.ecobee"
        }
      ],
      "failed": [],
    }
  },
  "conversation_id": "<generated-id-from-ha>",
}
```


### Error

An error occurred either during intent recognition or handling. See `data.code` for the specific type of error, and the [speech](#speech) property for the error message.

```json
{
  "response": {
    "response_type": "error",
    "language": "en",
    "data": {
      "code": "no_intent_match"
    },
    "speech": {
      "plain": {
        "speech": "Sorry, I didn't understand that"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`data.code` is a string that can be one of:

* `no_intent_match` - The input text did not match any intents.
* `no_valid_targets` - The targeted area, device, or entity does not exist.
* `failed_to_handle` - An unexpected error occurred while handling the intent.
* `unknown` - An error occurred outside the scope of intent processing.


## Speech

The spoken response to the user is provided in the `speech` property of the response. It can either be plain text (the default), or [SSML](https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis11/).

For plain text speech, the response will look like:

```json
{
  "response": {
    "response_type": "...",
    "speech": {
      "plain": {
        "speech": "...",
        "extra_data": null
      }
    }
  },
  "conversation_id": "<generated-id-from-ha>",
}
```

If the speech is [SSML](https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis11/), it will instead be:

```json
{
  "response": {
    "response_type": "...",
    "speech": {
      "ssml": {
        "speech": "...",
        "extra_data": null
      }
    }
  },
  "conversation_id": "<generated-id-from-ha>",
}
```

## Conversation Id

Conversations can be tracked by a unique id generated from within Home Assistant if supported by the answering conversation agent. To continue a conversation, retrieve the `conversation_id` from the HTTP API response (alongside the [intent response](#intent-response)) and add it to the next [input sentence](#input-sentence):

Initial input sentence:

```json
{
  "text": "Initial input sentence."
}
```

JSON response contains conversation id:

```json
{
  "conversation_id": "<generated-id-from-ha>",
  "response": {
    (intent response)
  }
}
```

POST with the next input sentence:

```json
{
  "text": "Related input sentence.",
  "conversation_id": "<generated-id-from-ha>"
}
```


## Pre-loading Sentences 

Sentences for a language can be pre-loaded using the WebSocket API:

```json
{
  "type": "conversation/prepare",
  "language": "en"
}
```

The following input fields are available:

| Name       | Type   | Description                                                                    |
|------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `language` | string | Optional. Language of the sentences to load (defaults to configured language). |
