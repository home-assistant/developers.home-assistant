The core of Home Assistant is built from the ground up to be easily extensible using integrations. In this section, we're focusing on how to develop integrations.

Before you start, make sure that you have read up on the overall [Home Assistant architecture](architecture_index.md) so that you are familiar with the concepts that make up Home Assistant.
