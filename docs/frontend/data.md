The frontend passes a single `hass` object around. This object contains the latest state and allows you to send commands back to the server.

Whenever a state changes, a new version of the objects that changed are created. So you can easily see if something has changed by doing a strict equality check:

```js
const changed = newVal !== oldVal;
```

In order to see the data available in the `hass` object, visit your HomeAssistant frontend in your favorite browser and open the browser's developer tools. On the elements panel, select the `<home-assistant>` element, or any other element that has the `hass` property, and then run the following command in the console panel:

```js
$0.hass
```

This method of reading the `hass` object should only be used as a reference. In order to interact with `hass` in your code, make sure it is passed to your code correctly.

## Data

### `hass.states`

An object containing the states of all entities in Home Assistant. The key is the entity_id, the value is the state object.

}
```

### `hass.user`

The logged in user.

```json
{
  "id": "758186e6a1854ee2896efbd593cb542c",
  "name": "Paulus",
  "is_owner": true,
  "is_admin": true,
  "credentials": [
    {
      "auth_provider_type": "homeassistant",
      "auth_provider_id": null
    }
  ]
}
```

## Methods

All methods starting with `call` are async methods. This means that they will return a `Promise` that will resolve with the result of the call.

### `hass.callService(domain, service, data)`

Call a service on the backend.

```js
hass.callService('light', 'turn_on', {
  entity_id: 'light.kitchen'
});
```

### `hass.callWS(message)`

Call a WebSocket command on the backend.

```js
this.hass.callWS({
  type: 'config/auth/create',
  name: 'Paulus',
}).then(userResponse =>
  console.log("Created user", userResponse.user.id));
```

### `hass.callApi(method, path, data)`

Call an API on the Home Assistant server. For example, if you want to fetch all Home Assistant snapshots by issuing a GET request to `/api/hassio/snapshots`:

```js
hass.callApi('get', 'hassio/snapshots')
  .then(snapshots => console.log('Received snapshots!', snapshots));
```

If you need to pass in data, pass a third argument:

```js
hass.callApi('delete', 'notify.html5', { subscription: 'abcdefgh' });
```

:::info
We're moving away from API calls and are migrating everything to `hass.callWS(message)` calls.
