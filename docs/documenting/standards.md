title: "Standards"
---

To ensure that the documentation for Home Assistant is consistent and easy to follow for both novice and expert users, we ask that you follow a very strict set of standards for developing the documentation.

## General Documentation

- The language of the documentation should be American-English.
- Don't put two spaces after a period and avoid the "Oxford comma".
- There is no limit for the line length. You are allowed to write in a flowing text style. This will make it easier to use the GitHub online editor in the future.
- Be objective and not gender favoring, polarizing, race related or religion inconsiderate.
- The case of brand names, services, protocols, integrations and platforms must match its respective counterpart. e.g., "Z-Wave" **not** "Zwave", "Z-wave", "Z Wave" or "ZWave". Also, "Input Select" **not** "input select" or "Input select".
- Do not use ALL CAPITALS for emphasis - use _italics_ instead.

## Integration and Platform Pages

- The **Configuration Variables** section must use the `{% configuration %}` tag.
- The **Configuration Variables** section is only used for YAML configuration.
- Configuration variables must document the requirement status (`false` or `true`).
- Configuration variables must document the default value, if any.
- Configuration variables must document the accepted value types (see [Configuration variables details](documenting/create-page.md#configuration)).
  - For configuration variables that accept multiple types, separate the types with a comma (i.e. `string, int`).
- Use YAML sequence syntax in the sample code if it is supported.
- All examples should be formatted to be included in `configuration.yaml` unless explicitly stated.
  - Use capital letters and `_` to indicate that the value needs to be replaced. E.g., `api_key: YOUR_API_KEY` or `api_key: REPLACE_ME`.
  - If you know that the API key or value contains [control characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML#Syntax), e.g., `#`, `[`, `?`, etc., wrap it in quotes and add a note.
- Integration and platform names should be a link to their respective documentation pages.

Example configuration block

```yaml
{% configuration %}
some_key:
  description: This is a description of what this key is for.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: Optional default value - leave out if there isn't one
{% endconfiguration %}
```

## Templates

- All examples containing Jinja2 templates should be wrapped **outside** of the code markdown with the `{% raw %}` tag.
- Do not use `states.switch.source.state` in templates. Instead use `states()` and `is_state()`.
- Use double quotes (`"`) for ([more information](#single-vs-double-quotation-marks)):
  - `friendly_name`
  - Single-line templates:
    - `value_template`
    - `level_template`
    - `icon_template`
    - Children of `data_template`
- Use single quotes (`'`) for ([more information](#single-vs-double-quotation-marks):
  - Strings inside of templates:
    - States
    - Entity IDs
  - `unit_of_measurement`
- No whitespace around pipe character (`|`) for Jinja2 filters.
- Single whitespace after Jinja2 opening delimiters ({% raw %}`{{`{% endraw %}).
- Single whitespace before Jinja2 closing delimiters ({% raw %}`}}`{% endraw %}).
- Do not quote values for:
  - `device_class`
  - `platform`
  - `condition`
  - `service`

## Renaming Pages

It can happen that an integration or platform is renamed, in this case the documentation needs to be updated as well. If you rename a page, add  `redirect_from:` to the file header and let it point to the old location/name of the page. Please consider to add details, like release number or old integration/platform name, to the page in a [note](/documenting/create-page.md/#html).

```text
---
...
redirect_from: /getting-started/android/
---
```

Adding a redirect also applies if you move content around in the [documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/).

## Single vs. Double Quotation Marks

Use single quotes (`'`) for strings inside of a template. It is more obvious to escape a single quote when necessary (i.e. `name` is a possessive noun), because the single quotes that wrap the string are closer in position to the apostrophe inside the string. Use double quotes (`"`) outside of a template (unless it is a multi-line template, in which case outside quotes are not required).

### Examples

#### Double Quotes Outside, Single Quotes Inside (Valid)

```yaml
automation:
  ...
  action:
    - service: notify.YOUR_NOTIFICATION_COMPONENT
      data_template:
        message: "{% if trigger.to_state.name == 'Dale\'s Bedroom' %}Someone's in your base, killing your noobs!{% else %}It's just another door.{% endif %}"
```

#### Single Quotes Outside, Double Quotes Inside (Invalid)

```yaml
automation:
  ...
  action:
    - service: notify.YOUR_NOTIFICATION_COMPONENT
      data_template:
        message: '{% if trigger.to_state.name == "Dale's Bedroom" %}Someone's in your base, killing your noobs!{% else %}It's just another door.{% endif %}'
```

#### Multi-Line Template (Valid)

```yaml
automation:
  ...
  action:
    - service: notify.YOUR_NOTIFICATION_COMPONENT
      data_template:
        message: >-
          {% if trigger.to_state.name == 'Dale\'s Bedroom' %}
            Someone's in your base, killing your noobs!
          {% else %}
            It's just another door.
          {% endif %}
```
