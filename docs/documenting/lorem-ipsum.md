title: Lorem ipsum - documentation structure and example text
---

This page shows examples of the available documentation features (such as inline icons, text box, links to related topics, and glossary entries). It also shows the documentation structure.

Much of this content you have already encountered in the developer documentation, under [Documentation standard](/docs/documenting/standards) or in the documentation rules of the [Integration Quality Scale](/docs/core/integration-quality-scale/rules/). This page here is meant to be used as a hands-on copy-paste-then-edit type of template.

## Inline text elements

This section shows elements you can use within your text.

### My links

To indicate a location in the UI, you can use a [My link](/docs/tools/quick-bar/#my-links). If the reader selects that link, that page opens in their installation. For example: "Go to {% my integrations title="**Settings** > **Devices & services**" %} and select your integration."

Screenshot showing the styling of my links:

<img class='invertDark'
    src='/img/en/documentation/my-links_formatting.png'
    alt='Screenshot showing the styling of my links'
  />

Here are a few examples:

```markdown
- {% my areas title="**Settings** > **Areas, labels & zones**" %}
- {% my automations title="**Settings** > **Automations & scenes**" %}
- {% my backup title="**Settings** > **System** > **Backups**" %}
- {% my general title="**Settings** > **System** > **General**" %}
- {% my logs title="**Settings** > **System** > **Logs**" %}
- {% my network title="**Settings** > **System** > **Network**" %}
- {% my profile title="**User profile**" %}
```

To identify a My link, in Home Assistant, open the page of interest and press the `m` key.

### Formatting

- Use bold when referring to UI strings: **Settings**, **Areas, labels & zones**
- Use backtick when referring to file paths, file names, variable names, or a text that you enter in a field: the `/boot/config.txt` file, the `this` variable, enter `/newbot`.

### Glossary term reference

Some Home Assistant terms and concepts are explained in a Glossary. If you add a reference to the definition of such a term, the term definition is shown as a tooltip.

<img class='invertDark'
    src='/img/en/documentation/glossary-term_tooltip.png'
    alt='Screenshot showing the styling of a glossary term tooltip'
  />

For example: {% term integration %}, {% term entity %}, and {% term "Home Assistant Operating System" %}. You can find the full list of glossary terms on the [Glossary](/docs/glossary/) page. To learn more about glossary terms, refer to the [developer documentation](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/documenting/standards#glossary--terminology-tooltips).

### Acronyms and abbreviations

If possible, try to avoid using abbreviations and acronyms.

If you want to use an acronym or abbreviation, you can add an abbreviation tag to show the full term as a tooltip.

<img class='invertDark'
    src='/img/en/documentation/abbreviation_tooltip.png'
    alt='Screenshot showing the styling of an abbreviation tooltip'

Here a few examples:

```markdown
<abbr title="Audio & video">A/V</abbr>,
<abbr title="current transformers">CT</abbr>,
<abbr title="Dutch smart meter requirement">DSMR</abbr>,
<abbr title="embedded MultiMediaCard">eMMC</abbr>,
<abbr title="flash video">FLV</abbr>,
<abbr title="Large Language Models">LLMs</abbr>,

<abbr title="real-time messaging protocol">RTMP</abbr>,
<abbr title="real-time streaming protocol">RTSP</abbr>,
or <abbr title="USB-On-The-Go">USB-OTG</abbr>.
```

### Inline icons

To refer to an icon in the UI, you can use icons from the [Iconify library](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/mdi/). 

Screenshot showing some inline icons:

<img class='invertDark'
    src='/img/en/documentation/inline_icons.png'
    alt='Screenshot showing some inline icons'
  />

Here are some examples:

```markdown

- Hamburger menu: {% icon "mdi:menu" %}
- Edit: {% icon "mdi:edit" %}
- Revert {% icon "mdi:restore" %}

- Upload network: {% icon "mdi:upload-network" %}
- Security network: {% icon "mdi:security-network" %}
- Routes: {% icon "mdi:routes" %}
```

## Collapsible text block

Use a details block to make a text block collapsible:

    alt='Screenshot showing a collapsible text block'
  />

Example:

```markdown
{% details "Generate Client ID and Client Secret" %}

1. Your Fitbit account must be registered as a Developer account at the [Fitbit Developer Portal](https://dev.fitbit.com), and have a verified email address.
2. Visit the [fitbit developer page](https://dev.fitbit.com/apps/new) to register an application.
3. Enter an **Application Name** of your choosing, for example **Home Assistant**.
4. ...
{% enddetails %}
```

## Text boxes

<img class='invertDark'
    src='/img/en/documentation/text_boxes.png'
    alt='Screenshot showing text boxes'
  />

Example:

```markdown
{% note %}
You can use a note to highlight a section.
{% endnote %}

{% important %}
You can use "important" to highlight a section that you feel is very important.
{% endimportant %}
```

## Reusable text

For some topics, there are predefined text elements that you can reuse.

### Configuration

## Videos

Use the following syntax to reference a video from Youtube, starting at a predefined time:

```html
<lite-youtube videoid="ZgoaoTpIhm8" videoStartAt="3907" videotitle="Introducing the Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition - Voice: Chapter 8"></lite-youtube>
```

<img class='invertDark'

## Document structure with dummy content

This section shows outlines the document structure and provides some example text. The example text includes some reusable text blocks (includes) such as `include integrations/config_flow.md` and styling elements such as `configuration_basic`.

The examples are taken from the [Integration Quality Scale](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/integration-quality-scale/rules/).

Local access token:
    description: "The local access token for your bridge. You can find it in the Integration app under **Bridge Settings** > **Local API**."
{% endconfiguration_basic %}

In case an integration is set up via YAML in the {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %}:

{% configuration %}
Host:
    description: "The IP address of your bridge. You can find it in your router or in the Integration app under **Bridge Settings** > **Local API**."
    required: false
    type: string

## Examples

### Turning off the LEDs during the night

The status LEDs on the device can be quite bright.
To tackle this, you can use this blueprint to easily automate the LEDs turning off when the sun goes down.

link to blueprint.

## Data updates

The **My** integration fetches data from the device every 5 minutes by default.
Newer devices (the ones running MyOS) have the possibility to push data.
In this case, pushing data is enabled when the integration is started. If enabling data push fails, the integration uses data {% term polling %}.

## Known limitations

The integration does not provide the ability to reboot, which can instead be done via the manufacturer's app.

## Troubleshooting

### Can’t set up the device

#### Symptom: “This device can’t be reached”

When trying to set up the integration, the form shows the message “This device can’t be reached”.

##### Description

This means the settings on the device are incorrect, since the device needs to be enabled for local communication.

##### Resolution

To resolve this issue, try the following steps:

1. Make sure your device is powered up (LEDs are on).
2. Make sure your device is connected to the internet:
   - Make sure the app of the manufacturer can see the device.
3. Make sure the device has the local communication enabled:
   - Check the device’s settings.
   - Check the device’s manual.
...

### I can't see my devices

Make sure the devices are visible and controllable via the manufacturer's app.
If they are not, check the device's power and network connection.

### The device goes unavailable after a day

Make sure you turned off the device's power-saving mode.

## Community notes

Note that some users have reported issues creating Home Assistant containers on ARM QNAP systems (for example, TS-233) with Container Station 3. A possible workaround is the "Docker compose" approach based on a YAML file (see section "Docker compose").

## Removing the integration

This integration follows standard integration removal.

{% include integrations/remove_device_service.md %}

After deleting the integration, go to the app of the manufacturer and remove the Home Assistant integration from there as well.
