title: "Example light platform"
---

This example is for adding support for the imaginary Awesome Lights. It shows the different best practices for developing a platform.

Similar to Example Sensor Platform, copy the code below, and create it as a file in `<config_dir>/custom_components/awesomelights/light.py`.

Add the following to your configuration.yaml:

```yaml
light:
  - platform: awesomelights
    host: HOST_HERE
    username: USERNAME_HERE
    password: PASSWORD_HERE_OR_secrets.yaml
```

Note the `platform` name matches the directory name that contains the source code.

```python
import logging

import voluptuous as vol

# Import the device class from the component that you want to support
from homeassistant.components.light import ATTR_BRIGHTNESS, Light, PLATFORM_SCHEMA
from homeassistant.const import CONF_HOST, CONF_USERNAME, CONF_PASSWORD
import homeassistant.helpers.config_validation as cv

# Home Assistant depends on 3rd party packages for API specific code.
REQUIREMENTS = ['awesome_lights==1.2.3']

_LOGGER = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Validation of the user's configuration
PLATFORM_SCHEMA = PLATFORM_SCHEMA.extend({
    vol.Required(CONF_HOST): cv.string,
    vol.Optional(CONF_USERNAME, default='admin'): cv.string,
    vol.Optional(CONF_PASSWORD): cv.string,
})


def setup_platform(hass, config, add_devices, discovery_info=None):
    """Setup the Awesome Light platform."""
    import awesomelights

    # Assign configuration variables. The configuration check takes care they are
    # present.
    host = config.get(CONF_HOST)
    username = config.get(CONF_USERNAME)
    password = config.get(CONF_PASSWORD)

    # Setup connection with devices/cloud
    hub = awesomelights.Hub(host, username, password)

    # Verify that passed in configuration works
    if not hub.is_valid_login():
        _LOGGER.error("Could not connect to AwesomeLight hub")
        return

    # Add devices
    add_devices(AwesomeLight(light) for light in hub.lights())



class AwesomeLight(Light):
    """Representation of an Awesome Light."""

    def __init__(self, light):
        """Initialize an AwesomeLight."""
        self._light = light
        self._name = light.name
        self._state = None

    @property
    def is_on(self):

    def turn_on(self, **kwargs):
        """Instruct the light to turn on.

        You can skip the brightness part if your light does not support
        brightness control.
        """
        self._light.brightness = kwargs.get(ATTR_BRIGHTNESS, 255)
        self._light.turn_on()

    def turn_off(self, **kwargs):
        """Instruct the light to turn off."""
        self._light.turn_off()

    def update(self):
        """Fetch new state data for this light.

        self._light.update()
