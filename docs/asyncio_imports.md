title: "Importing code with asyncio"
---

Determining when it is safe to import code when using asyncio can be tricky because two constraints need to be considered:

- Importing code can do blocking I/O to load the files from the disk
- Importing code in [cpython is not thread-safe](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/83065)

## Module level imports

If your imports are at the **module level** (also known as **top-level imports**), Home Assistant will import your code either **before the event loop starts** or **in the import executor** when your integration is loaded. In this case, you generally **donâ€™t need to worry** about whether your imports are safe.

## Imports outside of module level

If your imports are not happening at module level, you must carefully consider each import, as the import machinery has to read the module from disk which does blocking I/O. If possible, it's usually best to change to a module level import, as it avoids much complexity and the risk of mistakes. Importing modules is both CPU-intensive and involves blocking I/O, so it is crucial to ensure these operations are executed in the executor.

If you can be sure that the modules have already been imported, using a bare [`import`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import) statement is safe since Python will not load the modules again.

If the module will only ever be imported in a single place, the standard executor calls can be used:

- For imports inside of Home Assistant `hass.async_add_executor_job(_function_that_does_late_import)`
- For imports outside of Home Assistant: [`loop.run_in_executor(None, _function_that_does_late_import)`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.run_in_executor)
If the same module may be imported concurrently in different parts of the application, use the thread-safe `homeassistant.helpers.importlib.import_module` helper.

If its possible the module may be imported from multiple different paths, use `async_import_module`:

Example:

```python
from homeassistant.helpers.importlib import async_import_module

platform = await async_import_module(hass, f"homeassistant.components.homeassistant.triggers.{platform_name}")
```

## Determining if a module is already loaded

If you are unsure if a module is already loaded, you can check if the module is already in [`sys.modules`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.modules). You should know that the module will appear in `sys.modules` as soon as it begins loading, and [cpython imports are not thread-safe](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/83065). For this reason, it's important to consider race conditions when code may be imported from multiple paths.
