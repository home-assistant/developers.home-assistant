A cover entity is a device that controls an opening or cover, such as a garage door and window shade.  Derive entity platforms from [`homeassistant.components.cover.CoverDevice`](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/blob/master/homeassistant/components/cover/__init__.py).

## Properties

> Properties should always only return information from memory and not do I/O (like network requests). Implement `update()` or `async_update()` to fetch data.

### Platform Properties (to be implemented by deriving platform classes)

| Name | Type | Default | Description
| ---- | ---- | ------- | -----------
| current_cover_position | int | None | The current position of cover where 0 means closed and 100 is fully open.  Required with `SUPPORT_SET_POSITION`.
| current_cover_tilt_position | int | None | The current tilt position of the cover where 0 means closed/no tilt and 100 means open/maximum tilt.  Required with `SUPPORT_SET_TILT_POSITION`
| is_opening | bool | None | If the cover is opening or not. Used to determine `state`.
| is_closing | bool | None | If the cover is closing or not. Used to determine `state`.
| is_closed | bool | `NotImplementedError()` | If the cover is closed or not.  if the state is unknown, return `None`. Used to determine `state`.

### Entity Properties (base class properties which may be overridden)

| Name | Type | Default | Description
| ---- | ---- | ------- | -----------
| device_class | string | None | Describes the type/class of the cover. Must be `None` or one of the valid values from the table below.
| supported_features | int (bitwise) | Value determined from `current_cover_position` and `current_cover_tilt_position` | Describes the supported features. See the related table below for details.

### Device Classes
| Constant | Description 
|----------|-----------------------|
| `DEVICE_CLASS_AWNING` | Control of an awning, such as an exterior retractible window, door, or patio cover.
| `DEVICE_CLASS_BLIND` | Control of blinds, which are linked slats that expand or collapse to cover an opening or may be tilted to partially cover an opening, such as window blinds.
| `DEVICE_CLASS_CURTAIN` | Control of curtains or drapes, which is often fabric hung above a window or door that can be drawn open.
| `DEVICE_CLASS_DAMPER` | Control of a mechanical damper that reduces air flow, sound, or light.
| `DEVICE_CLASS_DOOR` | Control of a door or gate that provides access to an area.
| `DEVICE_CLASS_GARAGE` | Control of a garage door that provides access to a garage.
| `DEVICE_CLASS_SHADE` | Control of shades, which are a continuous plane of material or connected cells that expanded or collapsed over an opening, such as window shades.
| `DEVICE_CLASS_SHUTTER` | Control of shutters, which are linked slats that swing out/in to cover an opening or may be tilted to partially cover an opening, such as indoor or exterior window shutters.
| `DEVICE_CLASS_WINDOW` | Control of a physical window that opens and closes or may tilt.

### States
| Constant | Description
|----------|------------------------|
| `STATE_OPENING` | The cover is in the process of opening to reach a set position.
| `STATE_OPEN` | The cover has reached the open position.
| `STATE_CLOSING` | The cover is in the process of closing to reach a set position.
| `STATE_CLOSED` | The cover has reach the closed position.


### Supported Features

Supported features constants are combined using the bitwise or (`|`) operator.

| Constant | Description |
|----------|--------------------------------------|
| `SUPPORT_OPEN` | The cover supports being opened.
| `SUPPORT_CLOSE` | The cover supports being closed.
| `SUPPORT_SET_POSITION` | The cover supports moving to a specific position between opened and closed.
| `SUPPORT_STOP` | The cover supports stopping the current action (open, close, set position)
| `SUPPORT_OPEN_TILT` | The cover supports being tilting open.
| `SUPPORT_CLOSE_TILT` | The cover supports being tilting closed.
| `SUPPORT_SET_TILT_POSITION` | The cover supports moving to a specific tilt position between opened and closed.
| `SUPPORT_STOP_TILT` | The cover supports stopping the current tilt action (open, close, set position)

## Methods

### Open cover

Only implement this method if the flag `SUPPORT_OPEN` is set.

```python
class MyCover(CoverDevice):
    # Implement one of these methods.

    def open_cover(self, **kwargs):
        """Open the cover."""

    async def async_open_cover(self, **kwargs):
        """Open the cover."""
```

### Close cover

Only implement this method if the flag `SUPPORT_CLOSE` is set.

```python
class MyCover(CoverDevice):
    # Implement one of these methods.

    def close_cover(self, **kwargs):
        """Close cover."""

    async def async_close_cover(self, **kwargs):
        """Close cover."""
```

### Set cover position

Only implement this method if the flag `SUPPORT_SET_POSITION` is set.

```python
class MyCover(CoverDevice):
    # Implement one of these methods.

    def set_cover_position(self, **kwargs):
        """Move the cover to a specific position."""

    async def async_set_cover_position(self, **kwargs):
        """Move the cover to a specific position."""
```

### Stop cover

Only implement this method if the flag `SUPPORT_STOP` is set.

```python
class MyCover(CoverDevice):
    # Implement one of these methods.

    def stop_cover(self, **kwargs):
        """Stop the cover."""

    async def async_stop_cover(self, **kwargs):
        """Stop the cover."""
```

### Open cover tilt

Only implement this method if the flag `SUPPORT_OPEN_TILT` is set.

```python
class MyCover(CoverDevice):
    # Implement one of these methods.

    def open_cover_tilt(self, **kwargs):
        """Open the cover tilt."""

    async def async_open_cover_tilt(self, **kwargs):
        """Open the cover tilt."""
```

### Close cover tilt

Only implement this method if the flag `SUPPORT_CLOSE_TILT` is set.

```python
class MyCover(CoverDevice):
    # Implement one of these methods.

    def close_cover_tilt(self, **kwargs):
        """Close the cover tilt."""

    async def async_close_cover_tilt(self, **kwargs):
        """Close the cover tilt."""
```

### Set cover tilt position

Only implement this method if the flag `SUPPORT_SET_TILT_POSITION` is set.

```python
class MyCover(CoverDevice):
    # Implement one of these methods.

    def set_cover_tilt_position(self, **kwargs):
        """Move the cover tilt to a specific position."""

    async def async_set_cover_tilt_position(self, **kwargs):
        """Move the cover tilt to a specific position."""
```

### Stop cover tilt

Only implement this method if the flag `SUPPORT_STOP_TILT` is set.

```python
class MyCover(CoverDevice):
    # Implement one of these methods.

    def stop_cover_tilt(self, **kwargs):
        """Stop the cover."""

    async def async_stop_cover_tilt(self, **kwargs):
        """Stop the cover."""
```
