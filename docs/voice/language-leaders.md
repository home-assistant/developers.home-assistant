title: "Language Leaders"
---

Home Assistant is a global project. We want to make sure that everyone can use Home Assistant in their native language. For that reason, we have language leaders for each language to lead the maintenance.

Language leaders are responsible for reviewing the contributions in their language and making sure that they are grammatically correct.

Language leaders will be automatically notified of any new contribution to the language that they maintain. It's their responsibility to review the contribution and accept it.

Anyone can apply to become a language leader if they meet the following requirements:

- Be a native speaker of the language they want to lead
- Make 2+ pull requests to the intents repository
- Be involved with reviewing pull requests for the language

If you want to apply to be a language leader, join us in `#devs_voice` on Discord or [open a discussion topic](https://github.com/home-assistant/intents/discussions).

## Losing language leader status

A language leader is a gatekeeper for a language. If they are inactive, language contributions for that language are not processed.

If the inactivity of the language leader becomes a bottle neck, the language leader will be removed. If they want to regain their status, they can apply again.
