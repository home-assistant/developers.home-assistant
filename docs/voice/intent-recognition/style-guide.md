title: Response Style Guide
---

This document describes the style guide for responses.

## Be concise

Responses should be concise and to the point. They should not contain unnecessary information.

- If a command is targeting a single device, don't repeat the name of the entity in the response.
- If a command is targeting an area, don't repeat the name of the area or it's entities in the response.
- If a command is asking for a list of entities, list all if 4 or less. Otherwise list first 3 and say "+ 2 more".

## Use the correct tense

Responses should be in the present tense. For example, "The light is on" instead of "The light was on".

## Use the correct voice

Responses should be in the active voice. For example, "The light is on" instead of "The light is being turned on".
