## Capturing the user's speech

The thing that the above diagram does not describe is how the user's speech is captured. There will be many ways to do this.

The ultimate goal is to make **Voice Satellites**. These are devices that can be placed anywhere in the house. Once it detects the hot word, it will capture the user's speech, send it to Home Assistant, and play the response back to the user.
