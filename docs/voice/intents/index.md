See the Home Assistant Core documentation for intents for:

 - [Built-in intents](../../intent_builtin) that are supported by Home Assistant.
 - Use [the Conversation API](../../intent_conversation_api) to send text commands to Home Assistant and receive responses.
 - [Register intent handlers](../../intent_handling) to add new intents to Home Assistant.
 - [Fire intents](../../intent_firing) if you have your own sentence matching logic and want Home Assistant to handle the intents.
