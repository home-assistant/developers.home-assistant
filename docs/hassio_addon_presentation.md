title: "Presenting your addon"
---

If you decide to share your add-on to the public, paying attention to details is recommended. Of course, your add-on should have a proper name and description, but Home Assistant also gives you some other tools to present your add-on even nicer.

## Adding intro

This shows in add-on store and give the user a short instruction what the addon can.

This file containing the intro is usually referred to as the "README", which is generally published as the `README.md` file.

## Adding documentation

Good documentation helps the consumer of your add-on to understand its usage, explains configuration options, points users in the right direction in the case they have questions or issues, and contains the license under which the add-on was published.

This file containing the documentation is usually referred to as the "DOC", which is generally published as the `DOC.md` file.

## Add-on icon & logo

A picture is worth a thousand words. Therefore, your add-on can be improved by adding a proper image icon and logo. Those images are used when showing your add-on in the Home Assistant Supervisor panel and which will significantly improve the visual representation of your add-on.

Requirements for the logo of your add-on:

- The logo must be in the Portable Network Graphics format (`.png`).
- The filename must be `logo.png`.
- It is recommended to keep the logo size around 250x100px. You may choose to use a different size or aspect ratio as you seem fit for your add-on.

Requirements for the icon of your add-on:

- The icon must be in the Portable Network Graphics format (`.png`).
- The filename must be `icon.png`.
- The aspect ratio of the icon must be 1x1 (square).
- It is recommended to use an icon size of 128x128px.

## Keeping a changelog

It is likely you are going to release newer versions of your add-on in the future. In case that happens, the users of your add-on would see an upgrade notice and probably want to know what changes were made in the latest version.

A changelog is a file which contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of your add-on and is generally published as the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

If you are in need of a guide on keeping a changelog, we would recommend checking the [keep a changelog](http://keepachangelog.com) website. They have developed a standard that is used by many opensource projects around the world.

## AppArmor

You can use own security profile for you Add-on with AppArmor. Default it is enabled and use the Docker default profile. Put `apparmor.txt` file into your Add-on folder and it will load this file as primary profile. Use the config options to set the name of that profile.

## Ingress

Ingress allow users to access the add-on web interface via the Home Assistant UI. Authentication is handled by Home Assistant, so neither the user nor the add-on developer will need to care about the security or port forwarding. Users love this feature, however it is not every time simple to implement for the add-on developer.

To add Ingress support, follow the following steps:
- The add-on will need to provide the web interface on port `8099`. Make sure that the add-on accepts only connections from `172.30.32.2` on that port and that the connections are treated as authenticated.
- Update add-on configuration and set `ingress: true`. Here it is also possible to configure the Ingress port (default 8099). 
- If you need to configure the application inside your add-on with the right path and port, query the add-on info API endpoint.
- If the application doesn't support relative paths or you can't set a base url, you can use nginx filter to replace the URL with correct path.

Ingress API gateway supports the following:

 * HTTP/1.x
 * Streaming content
 * Websockets
