During development of Home Assistant integrations, you will come across different roles that are involved in the process. This document explains these roles and their responsibilities.

## Core members

Core members are contributors with write access to the Home Assistant Core repository.
They have the ability to review and merge pull requests, manage issues, and maintain the overall quality of the codebase. 
Core members are responsible for ensuring that contributions adhere to the project's guidelines and standards.

## Integration owners

Formerly known as "codeowners", integration owners are core members who have taken on the responsibility of maintaining specific integrations within Home Assistant.
Comments and concerns raised by integration owners are held in high regard, as they possess in-depth knowledge of the integration they oversee.
Integration owners are mentioned in every pull request that changes the code of their integration, and in every issue that is opened for their integration.

## Core team

The core team is a group of developers responsible for the overall direction and management of the Home Assistant Core project.
They are employed by The Open Home Foundation.
The core team generally meets every week to discuss pull requests and architectural proposals.
