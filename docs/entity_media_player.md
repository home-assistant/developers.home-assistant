:::info Incomplete
This entry is incomplete. Contribution welcome.
:::
A media player entity controls a media player.  Derive a platform entity from [`homeassistant.components.media_player.MediaPlayerEntity`](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/blob/master/homeassistant/components/media_player/__init__.py).

## Properties

:::tip
Properties should always only return information from memory and not do I/O (like network requests). Implement `update()` or `async_update()` to fetch data.
