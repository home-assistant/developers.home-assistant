## Translation Strings

Unlike localized strings merged in the `home-assistant` repository, custom components cannot take advantage of Lokalise for user-submitted translations. However, custom component authors can still include translations with their components. These will be read from the `translations` directory, adjacent to the component source. They are named `<platform name>.<language_code>.json`, e.g., for the German translation of a sensor `sensor.de.json`, unless the translation is for the custom component only, in which case the file is named `<language_code>.json` in the `translations` directory.

These files follow the same formatting as [backend translation string files](internationalization_backend_localization.md), but a copy will exist for each translated language.

The language codes follow the [BCP47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) format. The [frontend translation files](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant-polymer/tree/master/translations) can also be referred to if you are unsure of the correct language code to use.

To make sure that your translation files are correct, test with our integration validator Hassfest. [Set up instructions here.](https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog/2020/04/16/hassfest)
