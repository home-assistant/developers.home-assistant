An alarm control panel entity controls an alarm.  Derive a platform entity from [`homeassistant.components.alarm_control_panel.AlarmControlPanelEntity`](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/dev/homeassistant/components/alarm_control_panel/__init__.py).

## Properties

:::tip
Properties should always only return information from memory and not do I/O (like network requests). Implement `update()` or `async_update()` to fetch data.
