---

A climate entity controls temperature, humidity, or fans, such as A/C systems and humidifiers. Derive a platform entity from [`homeassistant.components.climate.ClimateEntity`](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/dev/homeassistant/components/climate/__init__.py)

## Properties

:::tip
Properties should always only return information from memory and not do I/O (like network requests). Implement `update()` or `async_update()` to fetch data.

### HVAC modes

You are only allowed to use the built-in HVAC modes, provided by the `HVACMode`
enum. If you want another mode, add a preset instead.


| Name                 | Description                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `HVACMode.OFF`       | The device is turned off.                                           |
| `HVACMode.HEAT`      | The device is set to heat to a target temperature.                  |
| `HVACMode.COOL`      | The device is set to cool to a target temperature.                  |
| `HVACMode.HEAT_COOL` | The device is set to heat/cool to a target temperature range.       |
| `HVACMode.AUTO`      | The device is set to a schedule, learned behavior, AI.              |
| `HVACMode.DRY`       | The device is set to dry/humidity mode.                             |
| `HVACMode.FAN_ONLY`  | The device only has the fan on. No heating or cooling taking place. |

### HVAC Action

The HVAC action describes the _current_ action. This is different from the mode, because if a device is set to heat, and the target temperature is already achieved, the device will not be actively heating anymore. It is only allowed to use the built-in HVAC actions, provided by the `HVACAction` enum.

| Name                    | Description           |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| `HVACAction.OFF`        | Device is turned off. |
| `HVACAction.PREHEATING` | Device is preheating. |
| `HVACAction.HEATING`    | Device is heating.    |
| `HVACAction.COOLING`    | Device is cooling.    |
| `HVACAction.DRYING`     | Device is drying.     |
| `HVACAction.FAN`        | Device has fan on.    |
| `HVACAction.IDLE`       | Device is idle.       |

### Presets

A device can have different presets that it might want to show to the user. Common presets are "Away" or "Eco". There are a couple of built-in presets that will offer translations, but you're also allowed to add custom presets.

| Name       | Description                                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `NONE`     | No preset is active                                    |
| `ECO`      | Device is running an energy-saving mode                |
| `AWAY`     | Device is in away mode                                 |
| `BOOST`    | Device turn all valve full up                          |
| `COMFORT`  | Device is in comfort mode                              |

| `SLEEP`    | Device is prepared for sleep                           |
| `ACTIVITY` | Device is reacting to activity (e.g. movement sensors) |

### Fan modes

A device's fan can have different states. There are a couple of built-in fan modes, but you're also allowed to use custom fan modes.

| ------------- |
| `FAN_ON`      |
| `FAN_OFF`     |
| `FAN_AUTO`    |
| `FAN_LOW`     |
| `FAN_MEDIUM`  |
| `FAN_HIGH`    |
| `FAN_MIDDLE`  |
| `FAN_FOCUS`   |
| `FAN_DIFFUSE` |

### Swing modes

The device fan can have different swing modes that it wants the user to know about/control.

| Name               | Description                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `SWING_OFF`        | The fan is not swinging.                          |
| `SWING_ON`         | The fan is swinging.                              |
| `SWING_VERTICAL`   | The fan is swinging vertical.                     |

and are combined using the bitwise or (`|`) operator.
