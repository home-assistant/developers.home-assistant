A binary sensor is a sensor that can only have two states. Derive entity platforms from [`homeassistant.components.binary_sensor.BinarySensorEntity`](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/blob/master/homeassistant/components/binary_sensor/__init__.py)

## Properties

:::tip
Properties should always only return information from memory and not do I/O (like network requests). Implement `update()` or `async_update()` to fetch data.
