:::info Incomplete
This entry is incomplete. Contribution welcome.
:::
A media player entity controls a media player.  Derive a platform entity from [`homeassistant.components.media_player.MediaPlayerEntity`](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/blob/master/homeassistant/components/media_player/__init__.py).

## Properties

:::tip
Properties should always only return information from memory and not do I/O (like network requests). Implement `update()` or `async_update()` to fetch data.
:::

| Name | Type | Default | Description
| ---- | ---- | ------- | -----------
| supported_features | int | int | Flag supported features.
| sound_mode | string | None | The current sound mode of the media player
| sound_mode_list | list | None | Dynamic list of available sound modes (set by platform, empty means sound mode not supported)
| source | string | None | The currently selected input source for the media player.
| source_list | list | None | The list of possible input sources for the media player. (This list should contain human readable names, suitable for frontend display)
| media_image_url | string | None | URL that represents the current image.
| media_image_remotely_accessible | boolean | False | Return `True` if property `media_image_url` is accessible outside of the home network.
| device_class | string | `None` | Type of media player.

## Supported Features

## Methods

### Select sound mode

Optional. Switch the sound mode of the media player.

```python
class MyMediaPlayer(MediaPlayerEntity):
    # Implement one of these methods.

    def select_sound_mode(self, sound_mode):
        """Switch the sound mode of the entity."""

    def async_select_sound_mode(self, sound_mode):
        """Switch the sound mode of the entity."""
```

### Select source

Optional. Switch the selected input source for the media player.

```python
class MyMediaPlayer(MediaPlayerEntity):
    # Implement one of these methods.

    def select_source(self, source):
        """Select input source."""

    def async_select_source(self, source):
        """Select input source."""
```

### Mediatype

Required. Returns one of the defined constants from the below list that matches the mediatype

| CONST |
|-------|
|MEDIA_TYPE_MUSIC|
|MEDIA_TYPE_TVSHOW|
|MEDIA_TYPE_MOVIE|
|MEDIA_TYPE_VIDEO|
|MEDIA_TYPE_EPISODE|
|MEDIA_TYPE_CHANNEL|
|MEDIA_TYPE_PLAYLIST|
|MEDIA_TYPE_IMAGE|
|MEDIA_TYPE_URL|
|MEDIA_TYPE_GAME|
|MEDIA_TYPE_APP|

```python
class MyMediaPlayer(MediaPlayerEntity):
    # Implement the following method.

    @property
    def media_content_type(self):
    """Content type of current playing media."""
```

:::info
Using the integration name as the `media_content_type` is also acceptable within the `play_media` service if the integration provides handling which does not map to the defined constants.
:::

### Available device classes

Optional. What type of media device is this. It will possibly map to google device types.

| Value | Description
| ----- | -----------
| tv | Device is a television type device.
| speaker | Device is speakers or stereo type device.
| receiver | Device is audio video receiver type device taking audio and outputting to speakers and video to some display.

### Proxy album art for media browser

Optional. If your media player is only accessible from the internal network, it will need to proxy the album art via Home Assistant to be able to work while away from home.

To proxy an image via Home Assistant, set the `thumbnail` property of a `BrowseMedia` item to a url generated by the `self.get_browse_image_url(media_content_type, media_content_id, media_image_id=None)` method. The browser will then fetch this url, which will result in a call to `async_get_browse_image(media_content_type, media_content_id, media_image_id=None)`.

In `async_get_browse_image`, use `self._async_fetch_image(url)` to fetch the image from the local network.

> Do not pass a url as `media_image_id`. This can allow an attacker to fetch any data from the local network.

```python
class MyMediaPlayer(MediaPlayerEntity):

    # Implement the following method.
    async def async_get_browse_image(self, media_content_type, media_content_id, media_image_id=None):
    """Serve album art. Returns (content, content_type)."""
    image_url = ...
    result = await self._async_fetch_image(image_url)
    if result == (None, None):
        _LOGGER.info("Error retrieving proxied album art from %s", image_url)
   return result
```

There are some helper functions defined in `media_player/__init__.py`. Use `self._async_fetch_image(url)` to retrieve an image at a given local url. Do not use `self._async_fetch_image_from_cache(url)` which should only be used to for the currently playing artwork.

In your media browser implementation, use `self.get_browse_image_url(media_content_type, media_content_id, browse_image)` to generate the thumbnail paramater for `BrowseMedia`.
