title: "IQS037 - Keep the config flow understandable and validate where needed"
---

IQS037 is as follows:

Keep the config flow understandable and validate where needed

## Reasoning

Not all Home Assistant users are tech-savvy, so we should make sure the config flow is used in an understandable way.
The things you can do to achieve this are:
- Use the proper selector at the proper place
- Validate the input where needed
- Use `data_description` in the `strings.json` to give context about the input field

## Example implementation


## Additional resources

All available selectors can be found in the [Home Assistant documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/blueprint/selectors/).

## Exceptions

There are no exceptions to this rule.
