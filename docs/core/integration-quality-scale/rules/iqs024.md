title: "IQS024 - Above average test coverage for all integration module"
---

IQS024 is as follows:

Above average test coverage for all integration module

## Reasoning

Since we support a lot of different integrations, we don't have every device or service available for testing.
This means that we can't test every change to every integration.
To make sure that we don't break anything, we need to have a good test coverage for all integration modules.
This prevents the introduction of bugs and regressions.

It also allows new developers to understand the codebase and make changes without breaking any existing use case.

## Additional resources
