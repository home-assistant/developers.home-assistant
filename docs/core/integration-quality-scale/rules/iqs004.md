IQS004 is as follows:

Full test coverage for the config flow

## Reasoning
The config flow is the first interaction a user has with your integration.
It is important to make sure that the config flow is working as expected and that the user can set up the integration without any issues, without running into any (config flow related) errors.

Since we want the user to have a smooth experience using the flows of an integration, this rule also applies to the reconfigure flow, the reauthentication flow and the options flow.

The extra added benefit of having tests for an integration is that it introduces the developer to testing, making it easier to write tests for other parts of the integration.

:::warning
Even though the code used to check uniqueness of a config entry is most likely touched by the happy flow tests, we still require tests for the uniqueness check.
:::

## Example implementation
We need to test the following scenarios for each way the config flow can be initiated, either by the user, by discovery or by an import flow.

The example below shows a basic happy flow initiated by the user.

`test_config_flow.py`:
```python
async def test_full_flow(
    hass: HomeAssistant,
    mock_my_client: AsyncMock,
    mock_setup_entry: AsyncMock,
) -> None:
    """Test full flow."""
    result = await hass.config_entries.flow.async_init(
        DOMAIN,
        context={"source": SOURCE_USER},
    )
    assert result["type"] is FlowResultType.FORM
    assert result["step_id"] == "user"

    result = await hass.config_entries.flow.async_configure(
        result["flow_id"],
        {CONF_HOST: "10.0.0.131"},
    )
    assert result["type"] is FlowResultType.CREATE_ENTRY
    assert result["title"] == "My integration"
    assert result["data"] == {
        CONF_HOST: "10.0.0.131",
    }
```
