IQS026 is as follows:

Implements diagnostics

## Reasoning

Diagnostics are an easy way to gather data about the integration and can prove useful when debugging an integration.

We consider it a good practice to have the diagnostics implemented.

## Example implementation

In the following example we provide diagnostics which includes data from various sources, such as the configuration and the current state of the integration.

`diagnostics.py`:
```python
async def async_get_config_entry_diagnostics(
    hass: HomeAssistant, entry: MyyConfigEntry
) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Return diagnostics for a config entry."""

    return {
        "device_model": entry.data[CONF_MODEL],
        "data": entry.runtime_data.data,
    }
```
