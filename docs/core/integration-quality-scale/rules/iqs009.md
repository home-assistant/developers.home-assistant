title: "IQS009 - If internet/device/service unavailable, log a warning once unavailable and once when back connected"
---

IQS009 is as follows:

If internet/device/service unavailable, log a warning once unavailable and once when back connected

## Reasoning

When a device or service is not reachable, the entities will usually go to unavailable.
To allow the user to find out why this is happening, we should log a warning when this happens.
Be sure to log a warning only once in total to avoid spamming the logs.

When the device or service is reachable again, we should log that as well.
This can prove useful for using the logs to find out when the device or service was unavailable and when it was back online.

## Example implementation

Since there are many different ways this can be implemented, we will only provide the example for entities updating via `async_update` and for integrations using the coordinator.

### Example for entities updating via `async_update`

In this example, we have a sensor that updates its value via `async_update`.
We will log a warning when the sensor is unavailable and log an info message when the sensor is back online.
Do note that we keep track of the warning being logged to avoid spamming the logs.

`sensor.py`
```python
class MySensor(SensorEntity):

    _warning_logged: bool = False

    async def async_update(self) -> None:
        try:
            data = await self.client.get_data()
        except MyException as ex:
            self._attr_available = False
            if not self._warning_logged:
                _LOGGER.warning("The sensor is unavailable: %s", ex)
                self._warning_logged = True
        else:
            self._attr_available = True
            self._attr_native_value = data.value
            if self._unavailable_warning_logged:
                _LOGGER.info("The sensor is back online")
                self._unavailable_warning_logged = False
```

### Example for integrations using the coordinator

In this example, we have an integration that uses a coordinator to fetch data.
The coordinator has the logic for logging once built in.
The only thing that you need to do in the coordinator is to raise `UpdateFailed` when the device or service is unavailable.

`coordinator.py`
```python
class MyCoordinator(DataUpdateCoordinator[MyData]):
    """Class to manage fetching data."""

    def __init__(self, hass: HomeAssistant, client: MyClient) -> None:
        """Initialize coordinator."""
        super().__init__(
            hass,
            logger=LOGGER,
            name=DOMAIN,
            update_interval=timedelta(minutes=1),
        )
        self.client = client
    
    async def _async_update_data(self) -> MyData:
        try:
            return await self.client.get_data()
        except MyException as ex:
            raise UpdateFailed(f"The device is unavailable: {ex}")
```
