title: "IQS025 - Has an integration owner"
---

IQS025 is as follows:

Has an integration owner

## Reasoning

Since Home Assistant integrates with many different devices and services, it is imaginable that the maintainers of the project can test every change.
Therefore, we have contributors who step up and are responsible for a specific integration.
They will get notified whenever there is a new issue or pull request for their integration.
This way, we keep track of the shared knowledge within the community and make sure that the integration is maintained.

We love integration owners!
We believe that integrations that have an owner are better maintained.
During reviews, we see the integration owner as the expert on the integration, and weigh their opinion higher than others.

## Example implementation

Integration owners are set in the `manifest.json`.

```json
{
  "domain": "my_integration",
  "name": "My Integration",
  "codeowners": ["@me"]
}
```

## Additional resources

More information about integration owners can be found in [ADR-0008](https://github.com/home-assistant/architecture/blob/master/adr/0008-code-owners.md).
