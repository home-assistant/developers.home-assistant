title: "IQS003 - Don't allow the same device or service to be able to be set up twice"
---

IQS003 is as follows:

Don't allow the same device or service to be able to be set up twice

## Reasoning

Since integrations are easy to setup with the UI, it could occur that the user accidentally sets up the same device or service twice.
This can lead to duplicated devices and entities with colliding unique identifiers, which has all kinds of negative side effects.
Making sure a config entry is uniquely identifiable is also important for any discovery flows, as otherwise they would discover devices that already have been setup.

Because we want to prevent this from happening, we need to make sure that the user can only set up a device or service once.

## Example implementation

There are 2 common ways an integration checks if it already has been setup.
The first way is by assigning a unique_id to the configuration entry.
The second way is by checking if pieces of the data in the configuration entry is unique.

The following examples show how to implement these checks in a config flow.

### Unique identifier

The first way is by assigning a unique_id to the configuration entry.
This unique_id is unique per domain, so another domain can use the same unique_id without problems.
Below is an example of a config flow that fetches the unique_id from the configuration entry and checks if it already exists.
If it does, the flow will abort and show an error message to the user.

`config_flow.py`:
```python
    async def async_step_user(
        self, user_input: dict[str, Any] | None = None
    ) -> ConfigFlowResult:
        """Handle a flow initialized by the user."""
        errors: dict[str, str] = {}
        if user_input:
            client = MyClient(user_input[CONF_HOST])
            try:
                identifier = await client.get_identifier()
            except MyException:
                errors["base"] = "cannot_connect"
            except Exception:  # noqa: BLE001
                errors["base"] = "unknown"
            else:
                await self.async_set_unique_id(identifier)
                self._abort_if_unique_id_configured()
                return self.async_create_entry(
                    title="MyIntegration",
                    data=user_input,
                )
        return self.async_show_form(
            step_id="user",
            data_schema=vol.Schema({vol.Required(CONF_HOST): str}),
            errors=errors,
        )
```

### Unique data

The second way is by checking if pieces of the data in the configuration entry is unique.
In the following example, the user fills in a host and port.
If there already is a configuration entry with the same host, the flow will abort and show an error message to the user.

`config_flow.py`:
```python
    async def async_step_user(
        self, user_input: dict[str, Any] | None = None
    ) -> ConfigFlowResult:
        """Handle a flow initialized by the user."""
        errors: dict[str, str] = {}
        if user_input:
            self._async_abort_entries_match({CONF_HOST: user_input[CONF_HOST]})
            client = MyClient(user_input[CONF_HOST], user_input[CONF_PORT])
            try:
                await client.get_data()
            except MyException:
                errors["base"] = "cannot_connect"
            except Exception:  # noqa: BLE001
                errors["base"] = "unknown"
            else:
                return self.async_create_entry(
                    title="MyIntegration",
                    data=user_input,
                )
        return self.async_show_form(
            step_id="user",
            data_schema=vol.Schema(
                {
                    vol.Required(CONF_HOST): str,
                    vol.Required(CONF_PORT): int,
                }
            ),
            errors=errors,
        )
```
