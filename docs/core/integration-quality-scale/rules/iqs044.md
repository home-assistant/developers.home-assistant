IQS044 is as follows:

The documentation describes all integration installation parameters

## Reasoning

When setting up an integration, there's nothing more frustrating than not knowing what information is asked for.
To improve the user experience, the documentation should describe all the parameters that are required during the installation process.
This should help the user to gather all the necessary information before starting the installation process.

## Example implementation

```markdown
## Installation

During the config flow, you need your login credentials, and the URL of your instance.
```
