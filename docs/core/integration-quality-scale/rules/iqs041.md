IQS041 is as follows:

The documentation describes use cases to inspire the end-user in using this integration

## Reasoning

Sometimes seeing a device or service being integrated in Home Assistant can have people respond "Why would I integrate this?".
For some integrations this is more straight forward than for others.

We think enriching the documentation with examples of these use cases can help the end-user understand the value of the integration.

## Example implementation

```markdown
The motion detection devices of MyCompany are cheap and usable.
When you combine it with their other device you can do x.
```
