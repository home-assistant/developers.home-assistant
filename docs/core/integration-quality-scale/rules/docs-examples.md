title: "The documentation provides automation examples the user can use."

## Reasoning

To show how the integration can be used, provide a limited set of blueprints, containing common or useful ones.
This will help users to get started with the integration faster and easier.

Upload the blueprints to the [blueprint exchange on the forums](https://community.home-assistant.io/c/blueprints-exchange) and on the integration page, add a link to the blueprint exchange.

Don't use the documentation pages as a collection or as a replacement of the blueprint exchange.

## Example implementation

```markdown showLineNumbers
## Examples

### Turning off the LEDs during the night

To tackle this, you can use this blueprint to easily automate the LEDs turning off when the sun goes down.
