IQS050 is as follows:

The documentation describes known limitations of the integrations (not to be confused with bugs)

## Reasoning

Users should know what to expect from an integration.
So we want to make sure that the documentation describes known limitations of the integrations.

We should refrain from noting down bugs, since we use the issue tracker at GitHub for that and we don't want to duplicate information.

## Example implementation

```markdown
## Known limitations

The integration does not provide the ability to reboot, which is available via the manufacturer's app.
```
