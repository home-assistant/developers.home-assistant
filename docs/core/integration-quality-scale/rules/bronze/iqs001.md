IQS001 is as follows:

Integration needs to be able to be set up via the UI

## Reasoning

Since its introduction in 2018, the config flow has become the standard way to set up integrations in Home Assistant.
They allow for a consistent user experience across integrations and provide a way to guide users through the setup process.

Because of the better user experience, we want to make sure that all integrations are able to set up via the config flow.

## Example implementation

To use a config flow in your integration, you need to create a `config_flow.py` file in your integration folder and set `config_flow` in your `manifest.json` to `true`.

`config_flow.py`:
```python
"""Config flow for my integration."""

from typing import Any

import voluptuous as vol

from homeassistant.config_entries import ConfigFlow, ConfigFlowResult
from homeassistant.const import CONF_HOST

from .const import DOMAIN


class MyConfigFlow(ConfigFlow, domain=DOMAIN):
    """My config flow."""

    async def async_step_user(
        self, user_input: dict[str, Any] | None = None
    ) -> ConfigFlowResult:
        """Handle a flow initialized by the user."""
        errors: dict[str, str] = {}
        if user_input:
            return self.async_create_entry(
                title="MyIntegration",
                data=user_input,
            )
        return self.async_show_form(
            step_id="user",
            data_schema=vol.Schema({vol.Required(CONF_HOST): str}),
            errors=errors,
        )
```

## Exceptions

The integrations that are exempt in [ADR-0010](https://github.com/home-assistant/architecture/blob/master/adr/0010-integration-configuration.md) are exempt from this rule.
