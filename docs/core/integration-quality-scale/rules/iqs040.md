IQS040 is as follows:

The documentation includes a high-level description of the brand, product, or service it integrates with; if available, with links to the brand, product, or service website

## Reasoning

When writing documentation for an integration, the first thing that usually comes top of mind by developers is describing what their integration does.
While it can be very helpful for users to also know what the integration is integrating with, it is often overlooked.
We think its a good practice to include a high-level description of the brand, product, or service that the integration is integrating with.

## Example implementation

```markdown
The **my integration** integration is used to integrate with the devices of [MyCompany](https://www.mycompany.com).
They create various smart home appliances and devices and are known for their MyProduct.
```

## Exceptions

Integrations that do not integrate with a device or service can't include this, thus they are exempt.
