title: "IQS040 - The documentation includes a high-level description of the brand, product, or service it integrates with; if available, with links to the brand, product, or service website"
---

IQS040 is as follows:

The documentation includes a high-level description of the brand, product, or service it integrates with.

## Reasoning

A high-level description of the brand, product, or service provides some context around the source of an integration.
This information might help users decide whether an integration suits them and their use case.
Ideally, the documentation also contains a link to the brand, product, or service website for further information.

## Example implementation

```markdown
The **my integration** {% term integrations %} is used to integrate with the devices of [MyCompany](https://www.mycompany.com).
They create various smart home appliances and devices and are known for their MyProduct.
```

## Exceptions

Integrations that do not integrate with a device or service can't include this, thus they are exempt.
