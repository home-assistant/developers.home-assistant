IQS051 is as follows:

The documentation provides troubleshooting information

## Reasoning

We should give the user enough information to figure out themselves on how to fix a common issue.
This decreases the amount of support requests and increases the user experience.

## Example implementation

```markdown
## Troubleshooting

### I can't see my devices
Make sure the devices are visible and controllable via the manufacturer's app.
If they are not, check the device's power and network connection.

### The device goes unavailable after a day
Make sure you turned off the device's power-saving mode.
```
