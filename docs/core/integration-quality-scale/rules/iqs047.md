IQS047 is as follows:

The documentation describes the supported functionality, including entities, and platforms

## Reasoning

Users should be able to understand what value the integration will add for their (to be bought) device.
This will help set users' expectations.

For example, if a user is looking for a new fridge, we should try to be clear about what they can expect from the integration.
If the integration only supports checking if the door is open or closed, they would be disappointed if they expected to be able to view the temperature of the fridge.

## Example implementation

```markdown
## Supported functionality

The integration will provide a sensor for all the measurements and will provide a switch to turn the device on and off.
```
