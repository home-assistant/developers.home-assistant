IQS042 is as follows:

The documentation provides step-by-step installation instructions for the integration, including, if needed, prerequisites

## Reasoning

We want users to have a smooth experience when setting up an integration.
This means that the documentation should provide clear and concise instructions on how to install the integration.
This includes any prerequisites that are needed to install the integration.

## Example implementation

```markdown
# Installation

1. Install the app off the app store
2. Create an account in the app
3. Add a device in the app
4. Go to the settings page in the app
5. Click the "Expose API" button
6. Continue at Home Assistant and add the integration
```
