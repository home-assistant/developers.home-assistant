title: "IQS042: The documentation provides removal instructions"

## Reasoning

Removing a device or service from Home Assistant isn't always straightforward.
The documentation should provide clear instructions on how to remove the device or service.

## Example implementation

```markdown showLineNumbers
To remove the integration, go to {% my integrations title="**Settings** > **Devices & services**" %} and select the integration card. Then, select the three dots {% icon "mdi:dots-vertical" %} menu and select **Delete**.
After deleting the integration, go to the app of the manufacturer and remove the Home Assistant integration from there as well.
```

## Exceptions

There are no exceptions to this rule.
