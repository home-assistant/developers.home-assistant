title: "IQS008 - If it's a polling integration, set an appropriate polling interval"
---

IQS008 is as follows:

If it's a polling integration, set an appropriate polling interval

## Reasoning

In an ideal world, all integrations would be a push based integration, where the device or service lets us know when there is new data.
This would decrease the amount of requests Home Assistant would make.

However, in the real world, many devices and services are not capable of push based communication, and we have to resort to polling.
In order to do this in a responsible way, we should set an appropriate polling interval that will serve the majority of users.

There is no real definition of what an appropriate polling interval is, as it depends on the device or service being polled.
We should for example not poll an air quality sensor every 5 seconds, as the data will not change that often.
In those cases, more than 99% of the users will probably be fine with a polling interval of about a minute.

To give another example, if we poll a cloud service for solar panel data where the data is updated every hour.
It would not make sense for us to poll every minute, as the data will not change between the polls.

For the users that do want to have more frequent updates, they can [define a custom polling interval](https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/general/#defining-a-custom-polling-interval)

## Example implementation

The polling interval can be set, either by setting `SCAN_INTERVAL` in the platform or by setting the `update_interval` in the coordinator.

`sensor.py`:
```python
SCAN_INTERVAL = timedelta(minutes=1)

class MySensor(SensorEntity):
```

`coordinator.py`:
```python
class MyCoordinator(DataUpdateCoordinator[MyData]):
    """Class to manage fetching data."""

    def __init__(self, hass: HomeAssistant) -> None:
        """Initialize coordinator."""
        super().__init__(
            hass,
            logger=LOGGER,
            name=DOMAIN,
            update_interval=timedelta(minutes=1),
        )
```
