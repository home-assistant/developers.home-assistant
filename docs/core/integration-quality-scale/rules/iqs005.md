IQS005 is as follows:

Support config entry unloading

## Reasoning

Sometimes a config entry ends up in a state where it is stuck.
This can be for many reasons, but the integration may work again after it has been reloaded.

In order to support this, the integration should support unloading the config entry.
This gives users the ability to reload the integration without having to restart Home Assistant.
Reloading an integration can be a powerful tool for users to fix issues with integrations.

## Example implementation

The code required to reload an integration is very little, with a lot of benefits for the user.

The method that has to be added to `__init__.py` looks very similar to the `async_setup_entry` method.

`__init__.py`:
```python
async def async_unload_entry(hass: HomeAssistant, entry: ConfigEntry) -> bool:
    """Unload a config entry."""
    return await hass.config_entries.async_unload_platforms(entry, PLATFORMS)
```

## Additional resources

More information about config entries and their lifecycle can be found in the [config entry documentation](../../../config_entries_index).

## Exceptions
