IQS038 is as follows:

Make effective use of the configuration entry data and options

## Reasoning

Configuration entries have 2 fields that are persisted, `data` and `options`.
`data` should be used for the data that is required for the connection to be made, while `options` is used for optional data that can be used to configure the integration.

Ideally, the `data` field should only be changed during a config, reauthentication or reconfigure flow.
The `options` field can be changed during the options flow.

## Example implementation
