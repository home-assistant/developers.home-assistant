title: "IQS032 - Reconfigure flow"

IQS032 is as follows:

Reconfigure flow

## Reasoning

It can happen that a user changes something to a device or service, like changing passwords or changing the IP address.
Ideally, Home Assistant catches those events and lets the user know that it requires a reauthentication or attention.
A reconfigure flow gives users the power to trigger a reconfiguration and allows them to update the configuration of the device or service, without the need to remove and re-add the device or service.

This gives users more ways to try and fix their issues, without the need for the software to be restarted or reauthentication to be triggered.
