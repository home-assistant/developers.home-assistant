IQS052 is as follows:

The documentation provides examples the user can use. For example (snippets of) configuration, automations, blueprints, scripts, or dashboards

## Reasoning

If devices are likely going to be used for a few use cases, we can provide blueprints or scripts to help them set it up.
This will help users to get started with the integration faster and easier.

## Example implementation

```markdown
## Examples

### Turning off the LEDs during the night
