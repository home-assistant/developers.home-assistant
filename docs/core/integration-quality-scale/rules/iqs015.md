---

IQS015 is as follows:

Entities use DeviceInfo correctly

## Reasoning

Devices are used to group entities into a single device.
This is useful, since users usually think they add a device to their system, not a single entity.
In order for the user to have the best experience, the fields of the DeviceInfo should ideally be filled out.

## Example implementation

In this example, there is a sensor entity that provides the device it will be added to.
This will provide a rich device info page, where the user can recognize the device by its name, serial number, and other fields.

`sensor.py`:
```python
class MySensor(SensorEntity):
    """Representation of a sensor."""

    _attr_has_entity_name = True

    def __init__(self, device: MyDevice) -> None:
        """Initialize the sensor."""
        self._attr_device_info = DeviceInfo(
            connections={(CONNECTION_NETWORK_MAC, device.mac)},
            name=device.name,
            serial_number=device.serial,
            hw_version=device.rev,
            sw_version=device.version,
            manufacturer="My Company",
            model="My Sensor",
            model_id="ABC-123",
            via_device={(DOMAIN, device.hub_id)},
        )
```

## Additional resources

More information about devices can be found in the [device](../../../device_registry_index) documentation.

## Exceptions
