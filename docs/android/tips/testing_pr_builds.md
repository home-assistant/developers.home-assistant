## Downloading APKs from a PR

You can test changes from a pull request without building locally by downloading the APK artifacts generated by CI.

1. Go to the pull request on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Checks** tab.
3. In the left sidebar, click on **Pull Request**.
4. Scroll to the bottom of the page to find the **Artifacts** section.
5. Download the **APKs** artifact (a ZIP file containing all APK variants).
6. Extract the ZIP and locate either the `full` or `minimal` APK.
7. Install the APK on your device:
   - **From the phone**: Download the artifact directly on your phone and install it using a file manager app.
   - **Using ADB**: Run `adb install path/to/app.apk` from your computer.

:::note
You must be logged in to your GitHub account to download artifacts. The CI workflow must also have completed successfully before the APKs are available for download.

:::note
The debug APK installs alongside the production version of the app, allowing you to have both installed simultaneously. The debug version has a red icon to distinguish it from the production app.
