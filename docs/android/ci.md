## Android Continuous Integration and Delivery

This document outlines the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) processes for the Android project. We use **GitHub Actions** as our CI/CD platform, with multiple workflows configured to ensure code quality, automate builds, and streamline deployments.

## Overview

The main goals of our CI/CD process are:

- ✅ Validate that everything is working as expected.
- 🚨 Notify relevant people if something breaks.
- 🚀 Enable fully automated continuous delivery of applications.
- 🔄 Avoid duplication by extracting common code into reusable local actions under `.github/actions`.

## Versioning

We follow the same versioning convention as the core project, using [CalVer] (Calendar Versioning). This ensures consistency across all releases.

## Workflows

### On pull request

When a pull request (PR) is opened or updated, the `pr.yml` workflow is triggered. Its goals are:

- 🧹 Validate code compliance with our [linters](/docs/android/linter).
- 🔨 Ensure the code builds successfully.
- ✅ Run all tests to verify correctness.
- 📦 Persist generated APKs in the GitHub Actions tab for review.

If any step fails:

- The CI notifies the PR owner.
- The PR is blocked from being merged until the issues are resolved.
- Fixes must be committed, which automatically restarts the workflow.

:::note
Only one workflow runs at a time for a given PR. If multiple commits are pushed in quick succession, the CI cancels ongoing builds and processes only the latest commit.
:::

#### Debug builds

To build the application in debug on CI, we use a mock Google services file located at `/.github/mock-google-services.json`.

#### Downloading APKs from a pull request

See the [Testing pull request builds](/docs/android/tips/testing_pr_builds) tip for instructions on how to download and install APKs from a pull request.

### On push to `main`

When a commit is pushed to the `main` branch, the `onPush.yml` workflow is triggered. Its goals are:

- 🌐 Download translations from [Lokalise](/docs/translations).
- 📝 Generate release notes.
- 🔧 Build release variants of all applications.
- 📤 Deploy applications to Firebase.
- 🛒 Deploy to the internal track of the Play Store.
- 📦 Persist generated APKs in the GitHub Actions tab.
- 🔐 Inject secrets and files required for publishing.

We use [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) to simplify deployment to different stores. All Fastlane configurations can be found in the `fastlane` folder.

:::note
This workflow can also be manually triggered with the `beta` flag to promote a build to the beta track on the stores.

### Weekly builds

Every Sunday at 4:00 AM UTC, the `weekly.yml` workflow is triggered automatically. Its goals are:

- 🛠 Create a weekly GitHub pre-release.
- 🚀 Invoke the `onPush.yml` workflow with the `beta` flag set to `true`.

This ensures that a new version of the applications is pushed to the beta track on the Play Store every week.

### Monthly version tags

On the first day of every month, the `monthly.yml` workflow runs to create an initial version tag in the format `YYYY.MM.0`. This aligns with our [CalVer] versioning strategy.

### Releases

The `release.yml` workflow is triggered manually to promote the latest beta build to production. This ensures that only stable and tested builds are released to end users.

#### Release on F-Droid

The [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org) store builds the applications themselves when we push a GitHub release. This process uses [metadata](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/blob/master/metadata/io.homeassistant.companion.android.minimal.yml).

Each GitHub release includes the following files used by F-Droid:

- `version_code.txt` - Used for the app's versioning (created on every release from the `main` branch)
- `strings.zip` - Contains all app translations from Lokalise at build time
- `locales_config.xml` - Generated [locales configuration](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/app-languages#use-localeconfig) from the downloaded app translations

:::warning
We do not guarantee when the applications will be available on F-Droid after a release. You can find the app [on F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.homeassistant.companion.android.minimal/).
:::

### On pre-release or monthly tag

When a release is created in the `pre-release` state or when a monthly tag is pushed, the `prepareNextRelease.yml` workflow is triggered. This workflow creates a pull request that updates the `changelog_master.xml` file to reflect the new version. Manual approval of this pull request is required. This process helps keep the changelog version consistent with the app version.

### Renovate lockfile updates

The `renovate-lockfiles.yml` workflow is automatically triggered when Renovate creates a pull request (branches matching `renovate/**`). It updates dependency lockfiles using `./gradlew alldependencies --write-locks` and commits the changes to the Renovate branch.

### Screenshot updates

The `updateScreenshot.yml` workflow can be manually triggered via workflow dispatch. It commits screenshot reference images for visual regression testing. Generating screenshots on CI infrastructure prevents rendering differences due to different configuration like the OS or hardware.
